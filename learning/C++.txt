C++ Encapsulation and Abstraction
#########################################################################

Encapsulation:(contain the information)
    ->wrapping up of data and information in a single unit
    ->binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.
    Two Important  property of Encapsulation:
        1->Data Protection-> by using private
        2->Information Hiding-> only public data is visible

Abstraction:(hide the information)
    ->displaying only essential information and ignoring the details
    Types of Abstraction:
        Data abstraction – shows the required information about the data and ignores unnecessary details.
        Control Abstraction – shows the required information about the implementation and ignores unnecessary details.
    Advantages of Data Abstraction
        ->Helps the user to avoid writing the low-level code
        ->Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
        ->Can change the internal implementation of the class independently without affecting the user.
        ->Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.
        ->It reduces the complexity as well as the redundancy of the code, therefore increasing the readability.
        ->New features or changes can be added to the system with minimal impact on existing code.

                            Abstraction	                                                                                                Encapsulation
1.	Abstraction is the process or method of gaining the information.	                            While encapsulation is the process or method to contain the information.
2.	In abstraction, problems are solved at the design or interface level.	                        While in encapsulation, problems are solved at the implementation level.
3.	Abstraction is the method of hiding the unwanted information.	                                Whereas encapsulation is a method to hide the data in a single entity or unit along with a method to protect information from outside.
4.	We can implement abstraction using abstract class and interfaces.	                            Whereas encapsulation can be implemented using by access modifier i.e. private, protected and public.
5.	In abstraction, implementation complexities are hidden using abstract classes and interfaces.	While in encapsulation, the data is hidden using methods of getters and setters.
6.	The objects that help to perform abstraction are encapsulated.	                                Whereas the objects that result in encapsulation need not be abstracted.
