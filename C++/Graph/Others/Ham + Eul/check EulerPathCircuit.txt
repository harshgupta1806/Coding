An Eulerian Path is a path in graph that visits every edge exactly once. An Eulerian Circuit is an Eulerian Path which starts and 
ends on the same vertex. Given an undirected connected graph with V nodes, and E edges, with adjacency list adj, return 2 if the 
graph contains an eulerian circuit, else if the graph contains an eulerian path, return 1, otherwise, return 0.


Eulerian Cycle: An undirected graph has Eulerian cycle if following two conditions are true. 
1.All vertices with non-zero degree are connected. We don’t care about vertices with zero degree because they don’t belong to Eulerian Cycle or Path (we only consider all edges). 
2.All vertices have even degree.

Eulerian Path: An undirected graph has Eulerian Path if following two conditions are true. 
1.Same as condition (a) for Eulerian Cycle.
2.If zero or two vertices have odd degree and all other vertices have even degree. Ep will start one and end on another.

Eulerian circuit in directed graphs: a directed graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if the following conditions are met:

1.All vertices have equal in-degree and out-degree.
2. all non zero degree vertices are strongly connected -> The graph is strongly connected 
(or, more generally, has a single strongly connected component).

    If the graph has one component and equal in-degree and out-degree at every vertex, 
    the conditions are sufficient to imply that the graph is strongly connected.

Conclusion:
If the graph is given to have a single component and equal in-degree and out-degree for every vertex, 
then the graph must be strongly connected.
