You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) 
and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

    int maxArea(vector<int>& h) {
        int l=0,r=h.size()-1,ans=0;
        while(l<r){
            ans=max(ans,min(h[l],h[r])*(r-l));
            if(h[l]<h[r]) l++;
            else r--;
        }
        return ans;
    }
