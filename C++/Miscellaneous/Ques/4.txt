You are given a 2D matrix of size nxm containing integer values. Your task is to remove exactly one row and one column from the matrix, resulting in four submatrices: top-left, top-right, bottom-left,

and bottom-right.

Define the following:

Top-left submatrix: The submatrix formed by the remaining rows and columns to the top and left of the removed row and column.

Top-right submatrix: The submatrix formed by the remaining rows to the top and columns to the right of the removed row and column.

Bottom-left submatrix: The submatrix formed by the remaining rows to the bottom and columns to the left of the removed row and column.

Bottom-right submatrix: The submatrix formed by the remaining rows and columns to the bottom and right of the removed row and column.

Your objective is to maximize the following expression: sum(Top-left)xsum(Bottom- right)+sum(Bottom-left)xsum(Top-right)

Return the maximum possible value of this expression after removing exactly one row and one column.
