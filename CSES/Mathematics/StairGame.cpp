/*
There is some intuition- to empty a pile a position k
, we will have to empty it all the way to position 1
, which means there are (kâˆ’1)
 copies of that pile which we have to empty.
So if k
 is odd, xor of k
 even number of times is 0
, so the odd positions don't create an effect, and hence we consider the even positions only.
