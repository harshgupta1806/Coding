You are given an array consisting of n integers which denote the position of a stall. 
You are also given an integer k which denotes the number of aggressive cows. 
You are given the task of assigning stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance 
between any two of them is the maximum possible.

    int solve(int n, int k, vector<int> &s) {
        sort(s.begin(),s.end());
        int l=0,h=s[n-1]-s[0];
        while(l<=h){
            int m=(l+h)/2,cc=1,prev=s[0];
            for(int i=1;i<s.size();i++){
                if(s[i]-prev >= m) {cc++;prev=s[i];}
                if(cc==k) break;
            }
            if(cc==k) l=m+1;
            else h=m-1;
        }
        return h;
    }
