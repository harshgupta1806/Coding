A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.


    string reverseWords(string s) {
        stringstream str(s);
        stack<string> st;
        string w,ans="";
        while (str >> w) {
            ans = " " + w + ans;
        }
        return ans.substr(1);
    }
