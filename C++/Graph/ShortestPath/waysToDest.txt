You are in a city that consists of n intersections numbered from 0 to n - 1 with 
bi-directional roads between some intersections. 
The inputs are generated such that you can reach any intersection from any other intersection and that
there is at most one road between any two intersections.
You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ui, vi, timei] 
means that there is a road between intersections ui and vi that takes timei minutes to travel. 
You want to know in how many ways you can travel from intersection 0 to intersection n - 1 in the shortest amount of time.

            adj[r[1]].push_back({r[0],r[2]});
