C++ Encapsulation and Abstraction
#########################################################################

Encapsulation:(contain the information)
    ->wrapping up of data and information in a single unit
    ->binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.
    Two Important  property of Encapsulation:
        1->Data Protection-> by using private
        2->Information Hiding-> only public data is visible

Abstraction:(hide the information)
    ->displaying only essential information and ignoring the details
    Types of Abstraction:
        Data abstraction – shows the required information about the data and ignores unnecessary details.
        Control Abstraction – shows the required information about the implementation and ignores unnecessary details.
    Advantages of Data Abstraction
        ->Helps the user to avoid writing the low-level code
        ->Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
        ->Can change the internal implementation of the class independently without affecting the user.
        ->Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.
        ->It reduces the complexity as well as the redundancy of the code, therefore increasing the readability.
        ->New features or changes can be added to the system with minimal impact on existing code.

                            Abstraction	                                                                                                Encapsulation
1.	Abstraction is the process or method of gaining the information.	                            While encapsulation is the process or method to contain the information.
2.	In abstraction, problems are solved at the design or interface level.	                        While in encapsulation, problems are solved at the implementation level.
3.	Abstraction is the method of hiding the unwanted information.	                                Whereas encapsulation is a method to hide the data in a single entity or unit along with a method to protect information from outside.
4.	We can implement abstraction using abstract class and interfaces.	                            Whereas encapsulation can be implemented using by access modifier i.e. private, protected and public.
5.	In abstraction, implementation complexities are hidden using abstract classes and interfaces.	While in encapsulation, the data is hidden using methods of getters and setters.
6.	The objects that help to perform abstraction are encapsulated.	                                Whereas the objects that result in encapsulation need not be abstracted.

C++ Polymorphism
#########################################################################

->ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
Types of Polymorphism:
    1->Compile-time Polymorphism
        A->Function Overloading:
            ->multiple functions with the same name but different parameters
            ->changing the number of arguments or/and changing the type of arguments
        B->Operator Overloading
            ```
                Complex operator+(Complex const& obj)
                {
                    Complex res;
                    res.real = real + obj.real;
                    res.imag = imag + obj.imag;
                    return res;
                }
            ```
    2->Runtime Polymorphism(Late binding OR dynamic polymorphism)
        A->Function Overriding
            ->when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.
            ->Runtime Polymorphism cannot be achieved by data members in C++.
            ->the parent class reference will always refer to the data member of the parent class.
        B->Virtual Function(w/o virtual -> Compile time)
            ->member function that is declared in the base class using the keyword virtual and is re-defined (Overridden) in the derived class.   
            Some Key Points About Virtual Functions:
                ->Dynamic in nature. 
                ->defined by inserting the keyword “virtual” 
                ->declared with a base class and overridden in a child class
                ->called during Runtime
            
Function Overriding in C++
    ->redefine the member function of a class which it inherited from its base class.
    ->when we call the function using its name for the parent object, the parent class function is executed. But when we call the function using the child object, the child class version will be executed.
    ->It can only be done in derived class.

    2 types in c++(in java only Compile time):
        ->Compile Time Overriding(early binding or static binding.)
            ->the function call and the definition is binded at the compilation of the program

        ->Runtime Function Overriding(late binding or dynamic binding)
            ->with the help of virtual functions.
            ```
                class Base {
                public:
                    virtual void display(){
                        cout << "Display method of Base class" << endl;
                    }
                    virtual ~Base() {}
                };
                class Derived : public Base {
                public:
                    void display() override{ ------------------------------->override keyword is used
                        cout << "Display method of Derived class" << endl;
                    }
                };
                int main()
                {
                    Base* basePtr;
                    Derived derivedObj;
                    basePtr = &derivedObj;
                    basePtr->display();---------------------->o/p -> Display method of Derived class
                    return 0;
                }
            ```

->The compiler maintains two things to serve this purpose:
    vtable: A table of function pointers, maintained per class. 
    vptr: A pointer to vtable, maintained per object instance (see this for an example).

C++ Function Overloading
#########################################################################

->where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters
->How does Function Overloading work?
    Exact match:- (Function name and Parameter)
    If a not exact match is found:–
        ->Char, Unsigned char, and short are promoted to an int.
        ->Float is promoted to double
    If no match is found:
        ->C++ tries to find a match through the standard conversion.
    ELSE ERROR

->We can have more than one constructor in a class with same name, as long as each has a different list of arguments.This concept is known as Constructor Overloading and is quite similar to function overloading. 
 
->In C++, following function declarations cannot be overloaded. 
    1->Function declarations that differ only in the return type.(Function overloading comes under the compile-time polymorphism. During compilation, the function signature is checked. So, functions can be overloaded, if the signatures are not the same. The return type of a function has no effect on function overloading, therefore the same function signature with different return type will not be overloaded. )
    2->Member function declarations with the same name and the name parameter-type-list cannot be overloaded if any of them is a static member function declaration
        static void fun(int i) {} ----> error
        void fun(int i) {}
    3-> int fun(int *ptr);
        int fun(int ptr[]); ->equivalent
    4-> void h(int ());
        void h(int (*)()); ->equivalent
    5-> Parameter declarations that differ only in the presence or absence of const and/or volatile are equivalent

with const keyword:(if const in parameter then cant differentiate)
    ```
        void fun() const
        {
            cout << "fun() const called " << endl;
        }
        void fun() { cout << "fun() called " << endl; }

        Test t1(10);

        No Error
        ->C++ allows functions to be overloaded on the basis of the const-ness of parameters only if the const parameter is a reference or a pointer
    ```

Function Overloading and float:

    ERROR -> "Ambiguity in Function Overloading”(could not find a function with double argument)
    ->To resolve -> test(3.5f, 5.6f);

Overloading wiht main():
    ->can be done by using main as a member function in a class
    ->w/o class gives error
    ->main is not reserved word in programming languages like C, C++, Java and C#.

#########################################################################
C++ Operator Overloading
#########################################################################

->compile-time polymorphism
->name of an operator function is always the operator keyword followed by the symbol of the operator

Following is the list of operators that cannot be overloaded. 
    sizeof
    typeid
    Scope resolution (::)
    Class member access operators (.(dot), .* (pointer to member operator))
    Ternary or conditional (?:)
    Operators that can be Overloaded in C++

We can overload
    Unary operators
    Binary operators
    Special operators ( [ ], (), etc)   

Operators that can be overloaded	            Examples
    Binary Arithmetic	                        +, -, *, /, %
    Unary Arithmetic 	                        + , -, ++, —
    Assignment	                                =, +=,*=, /=,-=, %=
    Bitwise	                                    & , | , << , >> , ~ , ^
    De-referencing	                            (->)
    Dynamic memory allocation, De-allocation	New, delete 
    Subscript	                                [ ]
    Function call 	                            ()
    Logical 	                                &,  | |, !
    Relational	                                >, < , = =, <=, >=

-> ComplexNumber c3 = c1 + c2; -> ComplexNumber c3 = c1.operator+ (c2);

    // Prefix ++
    Counter &operator++()
    {
        ++value;      // Increment value
        return *this; // Return the updated object
    }
    // Postfix ++
    Counter &operator++(int)
    {
        ++value;      // Increment value
        return *this; // Return the updated object
    }

    1->For operator overloading to work, at least one of the operands must be a user-defined class object.
    2->Conversion Operator: We can also write conversion operators that can be used to convert one type to another type. 
        operator float() const
        {
            return float(num) / float(den);
        }
        Fraction f(2, 5);
        float val = f;
    3->Any constructor that can be called with a single argument works as a conversion constructor


->Operator Overloading can be done by using two approaches, i.e.
    Overloading Unary Operator.
        ->no arguments should be passed
        ->works only with one class object
    Overloading Binary Operator.
        ->there should be one argument to be passed. 
        ->It is the overloading of an operator operating on two operands

Criteria/Rules to Define the Operator Function
    ->In the case of a non-static member function, the binary operator should have only one argument and the unary should not have an argument.
    ->In the case of a friend function, the binary operator should have only two arguments and the unary should have only one argument.
    ->Operators that cannot be overloaded are  .* :: ?:
    ->Operators that cannot be overloaded when declaring that function as friend function are = () [] ->.
    ->The operator function must be either a non-static (member function), global free function or a friend function.


Functors:
    ->C++ class that acts like a function.
    ->To create a functor, we create a object that overloads the operator().

        The line,
        MyFunctor(10);

        Is same as
        MyFunctor.operator()(10);
        ```
            class increment
            {
            private:
                int num;
            public:
                increment(int n) : num(n) {  }
                // This operator overloading enables calling operator   function () on objects of increment
                int operator () (int arr_num) const {
                    return num + arr_num;
                }
            };

            transform(arr, arr+n, arr, increment(to_add));
        ```

List of operators that cannot be overloaded
    1) Scope Resolution Operator  (::)    
    2) Ternary or Conditional Operator (?:)   
    3) Member Access or Dot operator  (.)    
    4) Pointer-to-member Operator (.*)  
    5) Object size Operator (sizeof) 
    6) Object type Operator(typeid) 
    7) static_cast (casting operator)
    8) const_cast (casting operator)
    9) reinterpret_cast (casting operator)
    10) dynamic_cast (casting operator)



#########################################################################
C++ Inheritance
#########################################################################

->The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class
->class  derived_class_name : access-specifier  base_class_name{//};
    ->access-specifier By Default: private
->A derived class doesn’t inherit access to private data members. However, it does inherit a full parent object, which contains any private members which that class declares.

Modes of Inheritance in C++
    Public Mode:
        public(base) -> public(derived)
        protected(base) -> protected(derived)
    Protected Mode:
        public(base) -> protected(derived)
        protected(base) -> protected(derived)
    Private Mode(default mode):
        public(base) -> private(derived)
        protected(base) -> private(derived)

->To access or update the private members of the base class in derived class, we have to use the corresponding getter and setter functions of the base class or declare the derived class as friend class.


Types Of Inheritance in C++
    Single inheritance:
        ->a class is allowed to inherit from only one class. i.e. one base class is inherited by one derived class only.

    Multiple inheritance
        ->a class can inherit from more than one class. i.e one subclass is inherited from more than one base class.

    Multilevel inheritance:
        ->a derived class is created from another derived class and that derived class can be derived from a base class or any other derived class. There can be any number of levels.
    
    Hierarchical inheritance:
        ->more than one subclass is inherited from a single base class. i.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class.

    Hybrid inheritance:
        ->implemented by combining more than one type of inheritance.
        ->A Special Case of Hybrid Inheritance: 
            Multipath Inheritance(diamond):
                ->a class is derived from two base classes and these two base classes in turn are derived from one common base class. 
                ->An ambiguity can arise in this type of inheritance in the most derived class. 
                ->This problem is also called diamond problem due to the diamond shape formed in the UML inheritance diagram.
                ->Constructor of the most superclass is called twice
                                 Person
                                /       \
                              faculty  student
                                \       /
                                    TA
                ->So object ‘ta1’ has two copies of all members of ‘Person’, this causes ambiguities.
                ->The solution to this problem is ‘virtual’ keyword. We make the classes ‘Faculty’ and ‘Student’ as virtual base classes to avoid two copies of ‘Person’ in ‘TA’ class.
                ->When we use ‘virtual’ keyword, the default constructor of grandparent class is called by default even if the parent classes explicitly call parameterized constructor.


->The constructors will be called by the complier in the order in which they are inherited. It means that base class constructors will be called first, then derived class constructors will be called.
->The destructors will be called in reverse order in which the compiler is declared.
->We can also call the constructors and destructors manually in the derived class.

Polymorphism in Inheritance:
    ->redefine the base class member function in the derived class called Function Overriding
    ->we can do it at both runtime and complile time. For runtime polymorphism, we have to use the virtual functions.


Difference between Inheritance and Friendship in C++: 
    ->In C++, friendship is not inherited. If a base class has a friend function, then the function doesn’t become a friend of the derived class(es). 



#########################################################################
C++ Virtual Functions
#########################################################################

->function that is declared within a base class and is re-defined (overridden) by a derived class
->They are mainly used to achieve Runtime polymorphism.
->Functions are declared with a virtual keyword in a base class.
->The resolving of a function call is done at runtime.


->Virtual functions cannot be static.
->A virtual function can be a friend function of another class.
->Virtual functions should be accessed using a pointer or reference of base class type to achieve runtime polymorphism.
->The prototype of virtual functions should be the same in the base as well as the derived class.
->They are always defined in the base class and overridden in a derived class. It is not mandatory for the derived class to override (or re-define the virtual function), in that case, the base class version of the function is used.
->A class may have a virtual destructor but it cannot have a virtual constructor.

Working of Virtual Functions (concept of VTABLE and VPTR)

    ->If an object of that class is created then a virtual pointer (VPTR) is inserted as a data member of the class to point to the VTABLE of that class. For each new object created, a new virtual pointer is inserted as a data member of that class.
    ->Irrespective of whether the object is created or not, the class contains as a member a static array of function pointers called VTABLE. Cells of this table store the address of each virtual function contained in that class.

Limitations of Virtual Functions:
    ->Slower
    ->Difficult to Debug

->Never call a virtual function from a CONSTRUCTOR or DESTRUCTOR

->By default, all the functions defined inside the class are implicitly or automatically considered as inline except virtual functions. 

Virtual Destructor:
    ->Making base class destructor virtual guarantees that the object of derived class is destructed properly, i.e., both base class and derived class destructors are called

Virtual Constructor:
    ->If we attempt to make a constructor virtual, the compiler will flag an error. In fact, apart from the inline keyword, no other keyword can be used in the constructor declaration.

Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes in C++:
    ->A class is abstract if it has at least one pure virtual function.
    ->We can have pointers and references of abstract class type.
    ->If we do not override the pure virtual function in the derived class, then the derived class also becomes an abstract class.
    ->An abstract class can have constructors. 

->for a pure virtual destructor, you must specify a destructor body.

Can Static Functions Be Virtual in C++:
    ->Virtual functions are invoked when you have a pointer or reference to an instance of a class. 
    ->Static functions aren’t tied to the instance of a class but they are tied to the class. 
    ->C++ doesn’t have pointers-to-class, so there is no scenario in which you could invoke a static function virtually.
